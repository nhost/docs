title: "Nhost CLI (beta)"
---

The CLI is your primary interface when doing local development.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install -g nhost
```

## Dependencies

The [Hasura CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/core/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.html#install-hasura-cli), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are dependencies, please make sure to have those installed.

### Hasura CLI version

Make sure you have at least the version of your Hasura version on Nhost. You can see your Hasura version on Nhost under Settings -> Hasura -> Hasura Version.

Check Hausra CLI

```bash
$ hasura version
```

Update your Hasura CLI:

```bash
$ hasura update-cli --version [version]
```

You can find Hasura's releases on their [GitHub release page](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases).

You might also need to update the cli-ext plugin:

```bash
$ hasura plugins cli-ext upgrade --version [version]
```

> Since version Hasura version [v2.0.0-alpha.5](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.5) the **cli-ext** plugin is a native part of the Hasura CLI and is no longer needed as a plugin.

## Usage

```bash
USAGE
  $ nhost [COMMAND]

COMMANDS
