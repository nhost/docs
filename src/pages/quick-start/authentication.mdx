title: "Authentication"
---

Currently, everyone can select and insert todos. That is ok to start with but now it's time to secure our API by adding authentication.

Authentication is built-in to Nhost and easy to get started.

## Create User

Let's first create our user by going to the project's **Auth** section.

![Add user](/images/quick-start/add-user.gif)

You will use this user to access your todos later on. But first, we will install [nhost-js-sdk](/libraries/nhost-js-sdk) to help us with authentication.

## Install and Configure nhost-js-sdk

> `nhost-js-sdk` is an open-source JavaScript library for interacting with Nhost's auth and storage.

```bash
$ npm install nhost-js-sdk
```

Now, we need to configure and initialize a connection to Nhost. Create a new folder, `src/utils`, and create `nhost.js` inside it.

```js:src/utils/nhost.js
import { createClient } from "nhost-js-sdk";

const config = {
  baseURL: "https://backend-REPLACE.nhost.app",
};

const { auth, storage } = createClient(config);

export { auth, storage };
```

Please don't forget to replace `https://backend-REPLACE.nhost.app` with your endpoint.

## Add NhostAuthProvider

Now it's time to wrap our `App` with another provider. The `NhostAuthProvider`. This provider indicates if a user is logged in or not in the `AuthGate` component that we'll implement soon.

First let's install the `@nhost/react-auth` package:

```bash
$ npm install @nhost/react-auth
```

We'll also pass our `auth` object as a prop to both providers, `NhostAuthProvider` and `NhostApolloProvider`, so that the whole app can share the same auth state.

```jsx{5,6,10,11,13,14}:src/index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { NhostApolloProvider } from "@nhost/react-apollo";
import { NhostAuthProvider } from "@nhost/react-auth";
import { auth } from "utils/nhost";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostAuthProvider auth={auth}>
      <NhostApolloProvider
        auth={auth}
        gqlEndpoint="https://hasura-REPLACE.nhost.app/v1/graphql"
      >
        <App />
      </NhostApolloProvider>
    </NhostAuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Now it's a good time to recap what has been done so far in this chapter. We started by creating a new user for our Nhost project, followed by installing and configuring `nhost-js-sdk`. Finally we wrapped our app with `NhostAuthProvider`, passing `auth` as a prop so that the same auth object gets used in both Nhost providers.

Now, let's create the login component.

## Login

We need to write a login component that handles the form's submission of a user's data and some scaffolding for the app routes.

Create a directory `src/components` and create the `Login` component with the following content:

```jsx:src/components/login.js
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";
import { auth } from "utils/nhost";

export function Login(props) {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
  const history = useHistory();

  async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    // login
    try {
      await auth.login({email, password});
    } catch (error) {
      alert("error logging in");
      console.error(error);
      return;
    }

    // redirect back to `/`
    history.push("/");
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Login</h1>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type="email"
          placeholder="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
        />
        <input
          type="password"
          placeholder="password"
          value={password}
          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button>Login</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now let's create two routes. One for `/` where we'll have our todos listed, and one for `/login` where users can log in.

```jsx{4,5,14,15,16,18,19,20,21,22,23}:src/index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { Login } from "components/login";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { NhostApolloProvider } from "@nhost/react-apollo";
import { NhostAuthProvider } from "@nhost/react-auth";
import { auth } from "utils/nhost";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostAuthProvider auth={auth}>
      <NhostApolloProvider
        auth={auth}
        gqlEndpoint="https://hasura-REPLACE.nhost.app/v1/graphql"
      >
        <Router>
          <Switch>
            <Route exact path="/login">
              <Login />
            </Route>
            <Route exact path="/">
              <App />
            </Route>
          </Switch>
        </Router>
      </NhostApolloProvider>
    </NhostAuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Finally, add two links to `App.js`. One to `/login` and one that will logout the user.

```jsx{3,4,21,22}:src/App.js
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { gql, useSubscription, useMutation } from "@apollo/client";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { auth } from "utils/nhost";

const GET_TODOS = gql`
  subscription {
    todos {
      id
      created_at
      name
      completed
    }
  }
`;

const INSERT_TODO = gql`
  mutation($todo: todos_insert_input!) {
    insert_todos(objects: [$todo]) {
      affected_rows
    }
  }
`;

function App() {
  const { data, loading } = useSubscription(GET_TODOS);
  const [insertTodo] = useMutation(INSERT_TODO);
  const [todoName, setTodoName] = useState("");

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="/login">Login</Link>
      <div onClick={() => auth.logout()}>Logout</div>
      <div>
        <form
          onSubmit={async (e) => {

          [...]

        </form>
      </div>
      {!data ? (
        "no data"
      ) : (
        <ul>
          {data.todos.map((todo) => {
            return <li key={todo.id}>{todo.name}</li>;
          })}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Phew, that's a lot of code. Let's stop here and recap what we have.

Both routes (`/` and `/login`) are still unprotected. We'll fix that soon. When we visit `/` we still see all todos. That's fine for now since we allow the `public` role to select them.

On the other hand, when we log in, we see **No data**. And if we log out again, our todos are back. What's going on?

When logged out, the `public` role was used, which still had permissions to select todos. When we log in, the `user` role was used instead, which doesn't have permission to select todos. Yet!

Things we need to do to secure our app:

- Protect the `/` route so that it is available to **logged-in** users only.
- Remove all permissions for the `public` role. Only **logged-in** users can insert and select todos.
- Add `user_id` to the `todos` table so that every todo belongs to a user.
- Set permissions so that users are only allowed to insert and select their todos.

## Auth Gate

Let's now create the `AuthGate` component that ensures only authenticated users can access specific routes.

```jsx:src/components/auth-gate.js
import { Redirect } from "react-router-dom";
import { useAuth } from "@nhost/react-auth";

export function AuthGate({ children }) {
  const { signedIn } = useAuth();

  if (signedIn === null) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (!signedIn) {
    return <Redirect to="/login" />;
  }

  return children;
}
```

`AuthGate` checks whether a user is logged in and redirects to `/login` otherwise.

In `src/index.js` we add the `AuthGate` component around the routes we want only logged-in users to access.

```jsx{5,20,24}:src/index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { Login } from "components/login";
import { AuthGate } from "components/auth-gate";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { NhostApolloProvider } from "@nhost/react-apollo";
import { NhostAuthProvider } from "@nhost/react-auth";
import { auth } from "util/nhost";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostAuthProvider auth={auth}>
      <NhostApolloProvider
        auth={auth}
        gqlEndpoint="https://hasura-xxx.nhost.app/v1/graphql"
      >
        <Router>
          <Switch>
            <Route exact path="/login">
              <Login />
            </Route>
            <AuthGate>
              <Route exact path="/">
                <App />
              </Route>
            </AuthGate>
          </Switch>
        </Router>
      </NhostApolloProvider>
    </NhostAuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Now users can only access `/` if they are logged-in.

## Connect todos to users

A todo should belong to a user and only be visible to that user. Before we do that **all existing todos must be deleted**. To delete all existing todos, click **Browse Rows** for the `todos` table, select all todos and click on the trash can icon.

That deleted all todos. Now let's add the new `user_id` column.

Click on **Modify** and then click the button **Add a new column**. Name the new column `user_id` with the type `UUID`. Make sure to **uncheck Nullable**. Click **Save**.

> `user_id` refers to the **id** of the **user** the todo belongs to.

![New user_id column](/images/add-authentication/new-user-id-column.png)

For our GraphQL API and database to understand that the `user_id` refers to the user's id we need to create a **Foreign Key**.

> A Foreign key is a link between two tables

The foreign key links the `users` table to the `todos` table.

You create the foreign key in the same **Modify** tab. Scroll down a bit to **Foreign Keys** and click **Add**. See the image below of how to set the Foreign Key and click **Save**.

![Foreign key](/images/add-authentication/create-foreign-key.png)

For Hasura to use the foreign key relation in the GraphQL API, we need to track the foreign key relationship. Go to the **DATA** tab and click **Track all**.

![Track all relationships](/images/add-authentication/track-all-relationships.png)

## Permissions for users

### Remove permissions for the public role

We won't use the `public` role anymore, so let's remove all permission for that role. See the image below.

![Remove public permissions from Hasura](/images/add-authentication/remove-public-permissions.png)

Now we'll add permissions for the `user` role.

> All logged-in users have the `user` role.

### Insert

First, we'll set the **Insert permission**.

A user can only insert `name` because all other columns will be set automatically. More specifically, `user_id` will be set to the id of the user making the request (`x-hasura-user-id`) and is configured in the `Column presets` section. See the image below.

![User insert permission](/images/add-authentication/user-insert-permission.png)

### Select

For **Select permission**, set a **custom check** so users can only select todos where `user_id` is the same as their user id. In other words: users are only allowed to select their own todos. See the image below.

![User select permission](/images/add-authentication/user-select-permission.png)

# The app is completed

You have probably already tested your app during this guide, but you have finished you're app. Congratulations!
