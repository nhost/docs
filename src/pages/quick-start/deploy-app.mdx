# Deploy app

Your app is ready to be deployed. You only need to deploy your frontend app since the backend is already deployed and production-ready at Nhost.

You can use your favorite platform to deploy your frontend app. We recommend using [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com), or [Stormkit](https://www.stormkit.io) because they are performant and easy to use.

For a more complete list of hosting alternatives, check the [Create React App Deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/).
