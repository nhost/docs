## Todo App

We are going to build a todo app using Nhost and React. We use React here, but Nhost is framework agnostic, so you can use whatever framework you like.
We will start by creating a backend on Nhost, followed by a React client application for managing todos. We will take an incremental approach to showcase Nhost's authentication system.

> As you follow this tutorial make sure to install the correct SDK dependencies for the current version of Nhost. Throughout this tutorial both `@nhost/react-apollo` and `@nhost/react-auth` are meant to be used on their version 1 (`@nhost/react-apollo@v1.1.3` and `@nhost/react-auth@v1.0.5` or lower releases) while version 2 of these packages are exclusive for the upcoming Nhost v2, now on private beta: [Nhost v2 Private Beta waitlist](https://waitlist.nhost.io/)

## Help

The quick start is simple enough that we expect you not to find any issues, but if you do, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SZnpVck) or at support@nhost.io.
